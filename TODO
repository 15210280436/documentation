- #layout-legend-x correct? between -2 and 3? and what are 'normalized coordinates'
- tyop #layout-legend-xanchor
- description in shapes, annotations
- valid 'dash' styles? #scatter-line-dash
- greater than, or greater than or equal to? e.g. maxdisplayed
- tyop #scatter-marker-colorbar-thicknessmode - missing *
- tyop #scatter-marker-colorbar-x bounds are missing
- copy_zstyle in 2d error bars? #scatter-error_x-copy_zstyle
- add x1 to axisid type
- is 'auto' always allowed in the angle type?

- Has only an effect if marker.color.line is set to a numerical array -- should be marker.color.line.color right? #scatter-marker-line-colorscale
- '(ragged or not)' ? what does ragged mean? in #heatmap
- replace e.g. marker.size with 'marker' in 'size'
- colorbar in histogram?
- better description of data_array
