# NOT RECOMMENDED
# When updating a chart's data remotely with an API call, we recommend 
# overwriting all of the chart's data instead of adding new traces.
# There are few cases where it is better to add new traces than overwrite all
# of the chart's data

import plotly.plotly as py
from plotly.graph_objs import *

new_trace = Scatter(
    x=[3, 4],
    y=[3, 2]
)

data = Data( [ new_trace1 ] )

# New traces are added to the plot in the order supplied
plot_url = py.plot(data, filename='append plot', fileopt='append')
