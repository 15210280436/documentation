But if you happen to run into an issue running the example, please let us know at our [Community Forums](http://community.plot.ly). By examining the code, you can further understand and experience the procedure in which Plotly plots are created. Something important to look at would be the data used in these examples; Because certain plots are only able to handle certain types of data (e.g: histograms are only useful for quantitative data), you will get an idea of the limitations and purpose of different plot types. In addition, you can see the effect certain parameters have the the data visualization and hopefully give you a sense of what's possible beyond the standard/default."

Now is the time for you to check out the **[Reference Page!](https://plot.ly/python/reference/)** The reference page details all the parameters that can be set for every type of plot that is possible in Plotly (ie: all the trace objects). In addition it also provides details on the possible parameters that are available to change in the `Layout` object as well.\n",
