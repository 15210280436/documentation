  Plotly graphs which use webgl receive a "webgl context" from the browser which gives them access to gpu resources.
  A program may lose its web context if the browser is overloaded with webgl contexts and is forced to shut one down.
  The event handler: `plotly_webglcontextlost`, can be used to trigger an event after a graph using webgl loses it's webgl context.
