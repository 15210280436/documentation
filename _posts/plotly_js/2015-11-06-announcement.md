A growing number of graphing tools and libraries allow us to make beautiful, interactive web-based graphs. By interactively visualizing our data online, we can learn more, allow others to explore data, work in teams, and paint a complete picture.

Today, Plotly announced that they have open-sourced plotly.js, the core technology and the  JavaScript graphing library behind Plotly’s online platform. Any developer can now integrate Plotly’s library into their own applications and access the power of D3.js - the popular JavaScript graphics library used by the New York Times - for scientific charting. Plotly.js supports 36 chart types, including 3D plots, geographic maps, and statistical charts like density plots, histograms, box plots, and contour plots.

> "Today, we’re announcing that the full version of plotly.js is entirely  free and open-source, under the MIT open-source license."
