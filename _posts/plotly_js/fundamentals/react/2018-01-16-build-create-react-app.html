  In this case, we want to use `react-plotly.js` without building `plotly.js` and use a version of `plotly.js` that is already built (see [building an external plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/react#with-external-plotlyjs)). This [demo app](http://react-plotly.js-demo.getforge.io/) was built with `create-react-app` and there 3 basic steps:

  1. Import plotly.js in a `</script>` tag in [public/index.html](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js-demo-app/blob/master/public/index.html#L25)
  2. Declare `Plotly` as a global in [App.js](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js-demo-app/blob/master/src/App.js#L1)
  3. Use `createPlotlyComponent()` in [App.js](https://github.com/plotly/react-plotly.js-demo-app/blob/master/src/App.js#L25)

  This lets us skip the [specific build configuration](https://plot.ly/javascript/react#build-with-webpack) necessary to build `plotly.js` in webpack environments (`create-react-app` uses webpack under the hood).
