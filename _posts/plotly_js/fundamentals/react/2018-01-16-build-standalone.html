  For quick one-off demos on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), you may wish to just load the component directly as a script tag. We don't host the bundle directly, so you should never rely on this to work forever or in production, but you can use a third-party service to load the factory version of the component from, for example, [https://unpkg.com/react-plotly.js@latest/dist/create-plotly-component.js](https://unpkg.com/react-plotly.js@latest/dist/create-plotly-component.js).

  You can load the component with:

  ```
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-plotly.js@1.0.1/dist/create-plotly-component.js"></script>
  ```

const Plot = createPlotlyComponent(Plotly);

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Plot, {
    data: [{x: [1, 2, 3], y: [2, 1, 3]}]
  }),
  document.getElementById('root')
);
