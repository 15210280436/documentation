  Many Plotly events emit event data when the event is triggered. Event data is information about the data point related to the event (i.e. the point clicked).<br>
  The following events emit event data:
  * `plotly_click`
  * `plotly_hover`
  * `plotly_unhover`
  * `plotly_selecting`
  * `plotly_selected`
  <br>Event data differs depending on the type of plot the user is interacting with. The event data structure for Cartesian (2D) plots, 3D plots, and maps can be found below, along with examples of how to use event data.
